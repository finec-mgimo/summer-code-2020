# Notes

## Why this is different from other summer classes at MGIMO

- project-based
- student collaboration via github/discord 
- mainly MGIMO students and partner organisations
- free to all who qualify

## Teaching Ideas

### Approaches:

- sandbox `->` many, many hardships `->` space rockets 
- map your learning trajectory (who is the trajectory owner?)
- data / model / domain application (in business/research)
- skills outside programming matter (personal/team communication, publicity, management, budgeting)
- what 'data science' means for finance / economists?

### Core skills:

- CLI vs GUI
- git is ok (code reuse + remote repos + issues + collaboration + CI)
- power of plain text (markdown, todo.txt)
- programming languages - start from print("Hello, world!")

### Avoid:

- 'blackbox' / 'silver bullet' / 'I need just push a button' / hypes (vs small wins) 
- tribalism (eg R vs Python), vendor overprimising ('Nobody gets fired for buying IBM')
- gatekeepers (everything is so hard)
- scams, overpromising (everything is easy)

## Ðžbjectives:

1. map realistic learning trajectory in reproducible data analysis, including risks and obstacles
2. demonstrate and discuss finished/published work as motivational examples in economic data analysis
3. get acquainted with personal success stories in data analysis and programming 
4. delimit 'data science' vs economic analysis vs data analysis in other fields (NLP, law)
5. try and practice various parts of 'data-model-decision' workflow, bridge gaps between textbook and real world examples
